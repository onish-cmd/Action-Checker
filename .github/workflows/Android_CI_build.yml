    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the source code
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Java environment
      # Android projects typically require JDK 17 or higher
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'gradle' # Cache Gradle dependencies for faster subsequent builds

      # Step 3: Grant execution permission to the Gradle wrapper
      # This is crucial because file permissions are lost when checking out code
      - name: Grant Execute Permission to gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 4: Run the Gradle build command
      # This command performs a clean build, runs lint checks, and assembles the release APK/AAB.
      # The 'app:assembleRelease' targets the 'app' module we've been working in.
      - name: Assemble Release Build
        run: ./gradlew clean app:assembleRelease --stacktrace
        
      # Optional Step 5: Upload the generated APK/AAB as an artifact
      # This makes the compiled file available to download directly from the GitHub run summary.
      - name: Upload Release Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
